Problem 6: 

Which problems do adaptive and predictive keyboards address? 
Explain how touch information and language information can be combined for keyboard adaptation. 
Explain decoding of touch sequences with token passing and beam pruning. 
Using Algorithm


Problems adaptive and predictive keyboards address are:
    When a user uses a touch screen keyboard, a user will not always be accurate.
    Typing ineffienceys, user body movement, to a user having sweaty hands to palm detection all of these 
    can be addressed using adaptive and predictive keyboards.

Explaination of how touch info and language info can be combined for keyboard adaptation: 
    Firstly key preditction is use in parrelle with key adaption 
    as if the user first types "Hel" the key prediction key will
    then give a high probablity to "l" as it would make sense for this letter.
    Now that the letter "l" has a higher chance of being click we therefore increase the
    touch area of the high probabilities letters. 

    Gaussian key model: p(t | k)
    Probablity of next letter: p(k)
    Probabilistic Keyboard Model: argmax(p(t | k) p(k))

Explaination of decoding touch sequences with token passing and beam pruning
    Token passing algorithm is a way to create probabilities of what key is more likely to be
    pressed next in context of its previous keys / letters.
    so for example initial Typing "c" the probability of "a" would be higher that "b"
    as in a language a vowel would typical come after a consonant. 
    Now this unmodified algorithm will then caculate the probabities of all letters, number and
    special characters and that would be too demanding for a mobile device there fore 
    we need to user beam searching to prune all keys that have too low of a probability and 
    dont bother calculating.
